    <h2>Hey there!</h2>
    I am a post-graduate in Microbiology with a strong passion for web development. While I'm currently seeking job opportunities in web development, I enjoy exploring the latest technologies and honing my coding skills. In my free time, I am a part-time gamer, indulging in a variety of games that challenge my strategic thinking and creativity. I'm eager to bring my diverse skill set to a dynamic team and contribute to innovative projects. Oh! and a big time foodie.
